## Data sources


1. Data Acquisition and Preparation:

- solar irradiance data: This will come from reliable sources like weather stations, satellite data (e.g., NASA's POWER project), or specialized solar data providers. The data needs to be location-specific and cover a significant time period to capture variability and trends.
- historical weather data: Factors like temperature, cloud cover, and humidity can influence solar output. 

2. Clean and process the data: This involves handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency in units and formats.
